# How to Use `.pylintrc` for Python Code Analysis

## Introduction
`.pylintrc` is a configuration file used by Pylint, a Python static code analysis tool. It allows you to customize Pylint's behavior according to your project's specific needs. This README will guide you through why and how to use `.pylintrc` effectively.

## Why Use `.pylintrc`?
- **Consistent Coding Standards**: Define and enforce coding standards across your project or team. Pylint can check for adherence to PEP 8 and other style guidelines.
- **Custom Rules**: Tailor Pylint's analysis to suit your project's requirements by enabling or disabling specific checks.
- **Suppress False Positives**: Sometimes Pylint might flag code as problematic when it's actually fine. `.pylintrc` allows you to suppress such warnings selectively.
- **Integration with CI/CD**: Incorporate Pylint into your continuous integration (CI) or continuous deployment (CD) pipeline to ensure code quality is maintained automatically.

## How to use

 

1. **Install Pylint:**
   ```bash
   pip install pylint

2. **Add `.pylintrc` in your code:**

3. **Run pylint of file or folder:**
    ```bash
    pylint folder-name # to run checks on all files inside the folder
    pylint folder-name/file-name.py # to run checks on single file
